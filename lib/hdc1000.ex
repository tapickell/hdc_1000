  This is a library for the HDC1000 Humidity & Temp Sensor

  Designed specifically to work with the HDC1000 sensor from Adafruit
  ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/2635
  These sensors use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to
  interface.

  Please note:
  TI has indicated that there's a 'settling' effect for the humidity and
  that you will need to re-hydrate the sensor once you receive it.
  To rehydrate it, place it in a location with 85% humidity for 24 hours
  or 60% humidity for 10 days.
